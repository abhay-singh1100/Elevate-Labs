# Logistic Regression Implementation Project

This project demonstrates comprehensive implementations of Logistic Regression with various advanced concepts and techniques in machine learning.

## Project Overview

The notebook `1.impelent.ipynb` contains several implementations and analyses of Logistic Regression, including:

1. Basic Logistic Regression Implementation
   - Dataset creation using make_classification
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Performance metrics analysis

2. Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Grid Search CV implementation
   - Random Search CV implementation
   - Parameter optimization

3. Multi-class Classification
   - Implementation of Logistic Regression for multiple classes
   - One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy
   - Performance evaluation

4. Imbalanced Dataset Handling
   - Creating and working with imbalanced datasets
   - Class weight adjustment
   - Performance evaluation on imbalanced data

5. ROC Curve and AUC Score Analysis
   - Implementation of ROC curves
   - Comparison with dummy classifier
   - Threshold analysis and visualization
   - AUC score calculation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Features

- Comprehensive implementation of Logistic Regression
- Advanced visualization of ROC curves with threshold annotations
- Multiple evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
- Comparison between different model optimization techniques

## Usage

The notebook is self-contained and includes:
