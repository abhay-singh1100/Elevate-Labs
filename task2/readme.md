# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** using Python and various data science libraries. The objective is to explore passenger data, preprocess it, and draw insights about the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

## 📂 File

- `titanic.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis, visualizations, and insights.

## 📊 Objective

- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize survival patterns
- Apply basic machine learning models to predict survival

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📝 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about:
- Passenger ID
- Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Name, sex, and age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket number and fare
- Cabin and port of embarkation

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Women and children had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers had significantly better chances of survival
- Age and fare also impacted survival likelihood

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with the required libraries.
3. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the notebook cell by cell.
